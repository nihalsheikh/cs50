# Week 2 Arrays

### Compiler Process

- This process in itself consists of 4 different stages
    - preprocessing
    - compiling
    - assembling
    - link

**Preprocessing**
    - In this stage, the c language preprocess the header file of code

**Compiling**
    - Tn this stage, the preprocessed file is then converted to assembly code

**Assembling**
    - In this stage, the assembly line code is then converted to Binary Code of all code and header file.

**Linking**
    - In this final stage, the Binary code is then linked, to form the final executable file.

### Debugging

- Process of finding the problem in the code and solving it
- you can do this by typing `debug50` in cmd line, watch and execute the code line by line and understand the code to solve the problem.

### Arrays 1D and 2D
- Storing multiple values together back to back
- Syntax: for example
    ```
        int ARRAY[] = {};
    ```
